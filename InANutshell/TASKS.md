# InANutshell - Task Overview

## Project Vision
**Goal**: Create a browser extension (Phase 1) and mobile app (Phase 2) for instant YouTube video summaries.

**Browser Extension User Flow**: 
1. User navigates to any YouTube video
2. Clicks the "ðŸ¥œ Summarize" button injected on the page
3. Extension extracts video transcript automatically
4. AI generates a concise summary
5. Summary appears in a modal overlay for quick reading

**Mobile App User Flow (Future Phase)**: 
1. User finds a YouTube video they want to summarize
2. Taps the "Share" button on the video
3. Selects "InANutshell" from the share options
4. App extracts video transcript and generates summary

## Technology Stack
- âœ… Browser Extension (Chrome Extension APIs, DOM manipulation)
- âœ… YouTube transcript extraction via DOM (implemented)
- [ ] AI summarization APIs (OpenAI, Claude, etc.) - IN PROGRESS
- [ ] iOS Share Extension development (Swift/SwiftUI) - FUTURE PHASE
- [ ] React Native mobile development - FUTURE PHASE

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Browser Extension (CURRENT FOCUS)
- [x] Set up monorepo architecture with browser extension
- [x] Implement YouTube transcript extraction via DOM
- [x] Create extension manifest and content scripts
- [ ] **CURRENT**: Fix extension import issues and test loading
- [ ] Integrate AI summarization service (OpenAI/Claude API)
- [ ] Polish extension UI and error handling
- [ ] Test on various YouTube videos
- [ ] Deploy to Chrome Web Store

### Phase 2: Mobile App Development (FUTURE)
- [ ] Research iOS Share Extension architecture
- [ ] Set up React Native development environment
- [ ] Create basic mobile app structure
- [ ] Implement Share Extension functionality
- [ ] Port browser extension logic to mobile
- [ ] Design mobile UI and user experience
- [ ] iOS/Android testing and deployment

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (FUTURE)
- [ ] Summary history and bookmarking
- [ ] Custom AI model fine-tuning
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Team/enterprise features
- [ ] Analytics and usage insights

## Current Sprint: Browser Extension MVP

### ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Fix browser extension import issue (ES6 modules â†’ browser-compatible)
- [ ] Test extension loading in Chrome (`chrome://extensions/`)
- [ ] Verify transcript extraction on real YouTube videos

### ðŸ“‹ NEXT UP
- [ ] Integrate AI API for summarization (OpenAI/Claude)
- [ ] Polish modal UI and loading states
- [ ] Add error handling for edge cases
- [ ] Test across different video types and lengths

### âœ… COMPLETED
- âœ… Monorepo setup with npm workspaces
- âœ… YouTube transcript extraction implementation (DOM-based)
- âœ… Browser extension manifest and structure
- âœ… Content script with modal UI
- âœ… Git repository and branch strategy
- âœ… Development documentation (README, CLAUDE.md)

## Current Status
**Branch**: `feature/youtube-api`  
**Blocker**: Extension ES6 import issue needs fixing  
**Next Session**: Fix imports â†’ test in Chrome â†’ integrate AI API
